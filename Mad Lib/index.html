        <h2>Mad Lib Results</h2>
        <p class='tragedy'>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the 
            <span id='nounReplacement'>Wise</span>?
             I thought not, it's not a story any 
             <span id='adjReplacement'>filthy</span> Jedi would tell you.
             It's a Sith legend.
              Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord
             of the Sith, so <span id='pNounReplacement'>powerful</span> and 
             so <span id='nounReplacement2'>wise</span> he could influence the 
             midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the 
             dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from 
             <span id='vingReplacement'>dy</span>ing. 
             The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. 
             He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, 
             of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his 
             apprentice <span id='verbReplacement'>killed</span> him in his sleep. Ironic. 
             He could save others from death, but not himself.
